# Mama's Jiaoziria

Pronounced jow-zi-ree-uh

## About

Mama's Jiaoziria is inspired by the Papa’s series of games, where you take on the role of a restaurant employee learning to make and serve delicious food. It also draws inspiration from Hack Club Juice’s game showcase in Shanghai, China, which is home to some of the best *jiaozi* (dumplings) around!

As a new employee at Mama's Jiaoziria, you’ll learn to craft perfect *jiaozi* (dumplings), take on a growing flood of orders, and impress even the toughest food critics.
